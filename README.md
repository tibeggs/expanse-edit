# The Expanse

This module is for The Expanse RPG by Green Ronin, for FoundryVTT based on the code from Andrew Nichols (studio315b) and The GranPickle
The Expanse uses the AGE game system.

Basically this add a few buttons to let you push descriptions into chat 

In addition there are slight modifications to the sheet to allow cost on items and allow the armor variable to be updated correctly.

Disclaimer

I am not a programer. This is a copy of the code for Blue Rose, just modified as the best I can for The Expanse.
